# 🏙️ Toronto Airbnb Price Prediction

This project predicts Airbnb listing prices across Toronto using advanced machine learning techniques, with a focus on the **XGBoost Regressor** model.

## 📊 Overview
We used Airbnb Toronto listing data to train a model that predicts prices based on host behavior, property type, reviews, and availability.

### 💡 Key Results
- **Model:** XGBoost Regressor  
- **R²:** 0.7947  
- **RMSE (log):** 0.0493  
- **MAE (log):** 0.0314  

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

### 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from **InsideAirbnb – Toronto Listings**.  
Due to licensing and size limits, the full dataset is **not included** in this repository.
